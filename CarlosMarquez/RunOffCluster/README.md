# Running in the Offline Cluster

Here I will write how to use these macros to run many files on the cluster offline.

PS
Not running here as it was too much information and filling up. So we decided to run everything in the ~/scratch2/marquez. I will make corrections later to make it easier.
That is the main reason for writting this macro outside.
