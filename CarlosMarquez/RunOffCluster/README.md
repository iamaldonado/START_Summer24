When we have too much information that we want to analyze, a good solution is to divide our data into different files and run them simultaneously, and finally we gather all the output files. To do this we will have to consider several aspects in order to run our analysis train.

Everything we should consider will be explained in detail in this work. We will explain in a general way each command and along with it we will give an example that was carried out successfully. Which ensures that it works the right way.


```ruby
ls /address_of_our_files/*range-number* > name_of_our_new_list.txt


PS
Not running here as it was too much information and filling up. So we decided to run everything in the ~/scratch2/marquez. I will make corrections later to make it easier.
That is the main reason for writting this macro outside.
